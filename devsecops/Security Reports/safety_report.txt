[31m-> Vulnerability found in setuptools version 66.1.1[0m
[1m   Vulnerability ID: [0m76752
[1m   Affected spec: [0m<78.1.1
[1m   ADVISORY: [0mAffected versions of Setuptools are vulnerable to Path
   Traversal via PackageIndex.download(). The impact is Arbitrary File
   Overwrite: An attacker would be allowed to write files to arbitrary
   locations on the filesystem with the permissions of the process running
   the Python code, which could escalate to RCE depending on the context.

[31m-> Vulnerability found in setuptools version 66.1.1[0m
[1m   Vulnerability ID: [0m72236
[1m   Affected spec: [0m<70.0.0
[1m   ADVISORY: [0mAffected versions of Setuptools allow for remote code
   execution via its download functions. These functions, which are used to
   download packages from URLs provided by users or retrieved from package
   index servers, are susceptible to code injection. If these functions are
   exposed to user-controlled inputs, such as package URLs, they can execute
   arbitrary commands on the system.
